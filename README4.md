Often when coding you will need to do your coding based off of a decision. The module then uses the example of drinking a cup of coffee as an if statement. If the coffee is too hot you dont want to drink it. An if else statement is an add on to a if statement and adds more options to the circumstance. To every if statement there is a conditional else statement included. In the example if the coffee wasnt at a certain heat, the program logged that the coffee was too hot. In the if else statement, the parameters were for cold temperature. In that instance the program logged that the coffee was too cold. The If the coffee wasnt too hot or too cold the program went to the else statement that logged that the coffee was just right.
