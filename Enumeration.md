Enums are a special datatype that has specific subset of possible values. An enumeration is places in a class if only that class needed access to it. The start of an enumeration is given by stating the key word enum then naming the enumeration (starting the name with a capitol letter). Then the values are places in parenthesis separated by commas. Each string in an enumeration is given a default integer starting at 0, which can be changes if specified. To change the type of enumeration, after the name place a colon and the type that would be desired. After an enum is created a variable can then be created from the enums type. Enumerations can also go be used and returned in functions.
