The first video was all about classes. A class is a the "box" of a program. It contains the different types of code for which a program can run. The use of classes help organize and direct the program so that 
it is easy to follow. Inside a class is objects. Objects make things available in a program. To make an object have value a instance needs to be called for the class. The value is given to the instances by 
constructors. By giving the objects value they are able to be used in the program and preform more functions.

The second video gives more information about scopes and access modifiers. Scopes are the area in code which the in which a variable can be used. These are seperated from eachother by use of brackets. 
Access modifiers are what shows certain functions and objects in the program and where it is accessable. The public modifier allows any part of the program to see the scope selected. If the modifier is 
private only that class will be able to use that part ofthe program. If something is needed in other parts of the code it must be identified as public, for the default setting in C# is private.
