Arrays are a way of storing a collection of data of the same type together. Declaring a array is similar to declaring a varaible except after the type of variable open and square brackets are used to create multiple variables. To specify the length of an array the key word 'new' is used followed by the type of the array and the number of elements in square brackets. To initialize an array using the name of the array followed by square brackets containing the index of the element. Another wat to create an array is by doing it all at once. This is done by calling the type and naming the array and then using curly braces with the value of the elements in the order that  it is to appear.
