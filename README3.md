All variables have what is called a datatype.  The two main types of datatypes are Value types and Reference types. Examples of value types are int, float, double, bool, and char. Structs are complex value types that contain one or more variables. Refenence types are anything that references a class. The main difference between the two datatypes is that if a value type varaible changes value, only that variable is changed. In a references type variable if a change is made all of variables with that reference will also change in value. If changing a datatype variable that is copied from another no change to the original will occur, but if changing one that is linked to the original by reference, a change will happen.

Variables can be thought of as boxes that contain information. You need a different type of box for each different type of information. The first thing done when making a variable is by calling the type. An int (integer) is a whole number. Next the variable is named and possibly ended with a semicolon or given a value. When you make a new script it is given Start and Update functions. Start is called when the object a script is attached to enters a scene. A function will take the box that we have storing information and give us boxes back or return. A function that doesnt return anything is void. A function that does have a return is given a type of function then a name followed by parameters. inside the parenthesis are the parameters, inside the curly braces are the actions of the function.
