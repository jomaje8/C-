Coding syntax simply means the structure of the language and some conventions are critical to read and write code. One example needed to understand is the dot operator, this is used to break down code to a specific compound element. Another peice of syntax is the semicolon which is used to end a line of code. Indenting is another part of coding that makes code readable and presentable. As a program is built, the farther away from the main function a line of code is, the more indents will be used. Comments are the last thing used to help code be more understandable. It is as it sounds, a comment on what a certain part of a function is helps explain what the code is there for and its purpose.


To start, the first difference between C# and Javascript syntax in that classes in C# and shown while they are hidden in Javascript. When creating variables in C# the type of variable is listed first, then the variable is named then optionally given a value. In Javascript variables start by using the code var followed by the name of the variable a colon and then the type and value. Functions in C# and created by stateing what type of variable will be returned followed by void if nothing is returned, then the function is named and given parameters. Javascript states that it is a function, names the function, provides parameters, then states what should be returned after a semicolon. Access modifiers in C# default to private, Javascript defaults to public.
