A switch statement is an alternative to if else statements. It will compare a single variable to a series of constants. To start a switch statement use the key word switch followed by the variable which it will be comparing. This is then followed by open and closed braces. Inside the braces a series of cases are defined. These cases are the constants that the switch statement will compare the cases against the variable. To create a case use the key word case followed by the constant and a colon. Then instructions are given and a break is set to keep following cases from accessing the prior cases. At the end of a switch statement a default case is set for anything that isnt defined in previous cases. This would be the else in an if else statement.
