Loops is a great way to repeat lines of code. There are four main types of loops, the while loop, the do while loopd, the for loop, and the for each loop. In the while loop it it started by stating the name while followed by iots conditions. As long as the conditions in the while loop are true, the loop will continue to run. The difference between a while loop and a do while loopis that a while loop tests the conditions in the body while the do while loops tests the conditions after the body. This means the body of a do while loop is gaurenteed to run at least once. The for loop functions similarly to the while loop but uses different syntax. The for loop starts with the keyword for, followed by three specific sections in parenthesis. The first section is optional and gives place to declare and initialize and variables wished to be used. next is the conditional which must be applied. This conditional will be evaluated before every reideration of the loop. The last section is an optional setting that will incrament or decrament the variable. For each loops are useful when sorting through variables in arrays. A for each loop will sort through a collection until it reaches the end of the collection.
